## So what's this all about then?

Well it is a website where occasionally I remember to put up little snippets of Tech goodness. Since its inception it has been hosted on Mambo/Joomla and more recently Drupal. Then I decided to abandon the old domain (digimatic.co.uk) and use a new one that felt more relevant to my interests and move to a simple static website, rather than CMS frameworks with features I didn't need.

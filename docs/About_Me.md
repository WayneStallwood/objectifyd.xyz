##So what's this all about then?

Well it is a website where occasionally I remember to put up little snippets of Tech goodness. Since its inception it has been hosted on Mambo/Joomla and more recently Drupal. Then I decided to abandon the old domain (digimatic.co.uk) and use a new one that felt more relevant to my interests.

##About me

I am an IT Professional with Broad Experience of Technology. I live in the South East of England.

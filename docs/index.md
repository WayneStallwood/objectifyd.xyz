[ObjectifyD.xyz](http://objectifyd.xyz): To give expression to (something, such as an abstract notion, feeling, or ideal) in a form that can be experienced by others.

My little dumping ground for various projects and thoughts.

As a geek and maker 3DP (3D Printing) was a fundamental step in my quest to make all those little gadgets I wanted but couldn't purchase. A way of experimenting with ideas using a very accessible platform for rapid prototyping. Hence Objectify(D) D for Design or 3D and the xyz Domain...you decide!

You can see some examples of work I've shared on Thingiverse [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/digimatic/designs) and other more detailed info in the Projects or OldStuff sections on this site.

Most recently I've been getting a little bit obsessed with Home Automation using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) so expect to see a few projects here soon. It just started with adding the regular smartplugs and lights, now it has become a mission to collect data and build rules and integrations for everything. Thanks to the excellent [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) Project I don't let silly things like the device not being "IoT Enabled" get in my way.
